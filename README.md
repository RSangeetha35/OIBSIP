OIBSIP
---

Welcome to my **Oasis Infobyte Internship**, where I have implemented multiple beginner-friendly yet practical **Python projects**. These applications showcase GUI interaction, automation, real-time data fetching, and logical computation using Python.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python 3** 🐍  
- **Tkinter** – For GUI development  
- **APIs** – For real-time weather data  
- **Libraries** – `random`, `requests`, `datetime`, `math`, etc.  
- **VS Code / Jupyter / IDLE**

📱 Project Details

### 💬 Chat App
A simple chat-like interface built using Tkinter that mimics basic message exchange. Great for understanding widget layout and event-driven programming.

- **Tech**: `Tkinter`
- **Features**: GUI-based, sends & receives dummy messages

---

### ⚖️ BMI Calculator
A GUI application to calculate **Body Mass Index (BMI)** based on the user's height and weight inputs.

- **Formula** (if height in cm): `BMI = (weight in kg × 10000) / (height in cm)^2`
- **Output**: BMI value and health category (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese)

---

### 🔐 Password Generator
A secure **random password generator** with configurable length and character mix (letters, numbers, special symbols).

- **Libraries**: `random`, `string`
- **Output**: Strong password suggestions
- **GUI**: Tkinter (optional based on implementation)

---

### 🌦️ Weather App
This app fetches **real-time weather data** for a given city using a public API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).

- **Libraries**: `requests`, `json`
- **Features**: Temperature, humidity, condition description
- **Output**: Displayed neatly on a GUI

---

### 🗣️ Voice Assistant
A basic **voice-controlled assistant** built using `speech_recognition` and `pyttsx3`.

- **Features**:
  - Voice input
  - Text-to-speech response
  - Handles simple commands like telling time, greetings, etc.
